# COMP250 Assignment 1 Winter 2020 Debugger
A series of testers for COMP250 Assignment 1 at McGill University.

To test your program:

Clone this repository into your project directory.

Change your package name to the correct name. (COMP250A1_W2020)

Run SuperTester.java

If you fail a tester:

Look at the error, look at your code and check for obvious oversights.

If nothing comes up, take a look at the tester code to better understand if an edge case is being tested.

Try the game tester with your problem, to see if you can recreate it by calling methods yourself.

To run a repeatable cruel tester, use a seed. Cruel tester is randomized and designed to be looped to test a variety of edge cases and strange behaviours. It is normal to sometimes fail cruel tester due to an illegal argument exception (as of current version, this will be patched) if it creates a hotel without the rooms it needs.



NOTE:
You are expected to have your own classes written as assigned which pass the Syntax Tester for this to run.

This repository will ignore correctly named class files from the assignment, so pulling it to your project will have no effect on existing code.
