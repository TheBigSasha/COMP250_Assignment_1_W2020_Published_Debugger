# COMP250 Assignment 1 Winter 2020 Debugger
A series of testers for COMP250 Assignment 1 at McGill University.

To test your program:

Clone this repository into your project directory.

Change your package name to the correct name. (COMP250A1_W2020)

Run SuperTester.java

NOTE:
You are expected to have your own classes written as assigned which pass the Syntax Tester for this to run.

This repository will ignore correctly named class files from the assignment, so pulling it to your project will have no effect on existing code.

If you wish to collaborate, or have any questions contact me at sasha@sashaphoto.ca
